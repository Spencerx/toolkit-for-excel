Simple unit testing provided:

excel-unit-test.xqy - tests the functions found in spreadsheet-ml-support.xqy. The tests save to a text file. (edit the path/name as required)  You can set this up to run regularly, doing a diff on the output compared with a base file, so any changes/errors that may occur as you edit the apis are detected.
